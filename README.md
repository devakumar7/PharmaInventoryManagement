Project Description
SpringBoot REST Application for Pharmaceutical Inventory Management System that aims to digitalize the process of book-keeping process of bulk pharmaceutical orders including ordering, billing, and inventory management.

The main purpose is to improve the efficiency in operations and logistics by eradicating the daily paperwork. With this system the tasks would be performed in less amount of time and more efficiently. With the data from the order table and inventory, management could make use of the order frequency and the stockout which would help the seller in getting more business insights from the monthly/yearly figures can be checked by the billing module to see the trends in sales and profits. These benefits can potentially result in generation of more revenues for the seller.

Purpose
This application was developed as a final project during my training period This is initial module developed by me and looking forward to add additional modules and integrate them with this. This project helped me familiarize with the issues that occur in real-time projects such as maintaining consistent database schema, variable names, libraries versions etc.
